__POD Generator__
================

By: _Jstith_

## Description

This program takes in user input and generates a POD (Plan of the Day) in Markdown format for use on the markdown-rendered sharepoint site for the USCGA PODs. This program will allow cadets to create markdown PODs without needing to understand writing markdown code. This repository also holds the necessary information to format the PODs with markdown by hand if necessary.

## Distribution

The program is written in python with pysimplegui, but the intented distribution is as a stand-alone windows binary for use on cadet laptops. For this reason, all data and functionality is containted in a single file for simple compiling with pyinstaller.
